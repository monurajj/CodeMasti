# CodeMasti — Investor Pitch

**One-liner:**  
CodeMasti is a cost-efficient, future-ready coding education platform for school students (Class 5–10) in India. We teach students to **think, solve, and create** — not just write code.

**Tagline:** Think. Solve. Create.

---

## 1. The Problem

- **Huge skill gap:** Schools focus on theory; the job market demands practical tech and problem-solving skills. Students leave school underprepared for an AI-driven world.
- **High cost of existing platforms:** Most coding/edtech products are priced for premium segments. A large share of Indian families cannot afford them.
- **Overhyped, age-inappropriate AI education:** Students are pushed into “AI” and advanced topics without strong foundations in logic and programming.
- **Fear of coding:** Many students (and parents) believe coding is only for “smart” kids or too difficult, so they never start.

**Result:** Millions of students in Classes 5–10 lack access to affordable, age-appropriate coding education that builds real skills and confidence.

## 2. Our Solution

CodeMasti is a **structured, age-appropriate, and affordable** coding journey designed for Indian school students.

We focus on:

| Principle | What we do |
|-----------|------------|
| **Logic before language** | Strong foundations in logical thinking and problem-solving before syntax-heavy coding. |
| **Projects before theory** | Hands-on projects and challenges so learning is tangible and engaging. |
| **Confidence before complexity** | Remove fear of coding; then scale up to Python, projects, and AI concepts. |

We are **not** teaching syntax for its own sake. We are building **how students think, solve, and create** in an AI-driven world.

## 3. Product & Offering

### Three programs (by age)

| Program | Class | Focus | Outcome |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| **SPARK** | 5–6 | Logical thinking, visual programming, flowcharts, problem-solving | Curiosity and confidence with technology |
| **BUILDERS** | 7–8 | Python fundamentals, conditions/loops/functions, mini projects | Can write code and build simple applications |
| **INNOVATORS** | 9–10 | Advanced Python, project-based learning, AI concepts, career awareness | Think like engineers and innovators |

### Delivery

- **Live interactive sessions** — 2 classes/week (e.g. Saturday + Sunday).
- **Weekly challenges** and **project-based assessments**.
- **Gamified learning**, certificates, and clear progression (Spark → Build → Innovate).
- **Program length:** 6–10 months depending on batch; classes begin May 2026.

### Pricing (indicative)

- **Registration fee:** ₹2,499 (SPARK) / ₹2,999 (BUILDERS) / ₹3,499 (INNOVATORS) — with **early-bird scholarship** (e.g. 75% off in Feb, 50% in Mar, 25% in Apr).
- **Monthly fee:** ₹1,499 (SPARK) / ₹1,999 (BUILDERS) / ₹2,499 (INNOVATORS).

Positioned **well below** typical premium coding bootcamps and many edtech offerings, so we can reach Tier-2 and Tier-3 families.

## 4. Market Opportunity

- **India K–12 edtech** is one of the largest and fastest-growing segments globally. Parents increasingly spend on future-ready skills.
- **Coding for kids / school students** is a clear category: NEP emphasis on digital literacy, government push for coding in schools, and rising awareness of tech careers.
- **Target segment:** Students in Class 5–10 and their parents across **Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3** cities who want quality coding education at a price they can afford.
- **Differentiation:** Most players are either premium (high price) or shallow (gamification without depth). CodeMasti aims to be **affordable + rigorous + age-appropriate**.

---

## 5. Business Model

- **Registration fee** (one-time per program) — secures commitment and covers onboarding.
- **Monthly subscription** — recurring revenue for the program duration (6–10 months).
- **Early-bird scholarships** — used for launch traction and fill cohorts; can be tuned over time.
- **Future:** School partnerships, B2B, curriculum licensing, and expansion to adjacent grades/subjects are possible growth levers.

---

## 6. Why We Are Different

- **Cost-efficient pricing** for Indian families — we are built for accessibility, not only premium metros.
- **No hype, no shortcuts** — strong fundamentals first; AI and advanced topics only after a solid base.
- **Age-appropriate curriculum** — SPARK / BUILDERS / INNOVATORS aligned to cognitive stage and school grades.
- **Hands-on projects and challenges** — learning by doing, not passive video consumption.
- **Clear learning progression** — Spark → Build → Innovate creates a long-term relationship and upsell path.
- **Mission-led** — we measure success by impact (thinking, solving, creating), not just completion rates.

## 7. Traction & Stage

- **Product:** Website live (codemasti.com) with full user journey: Programs, Register, Contact, About, legal pages.
- **Registration & payments:** End-to-end registration flow with **PhonePe** integration (Pay Now / Pay Later).
- **Operations:** Registrations and leads captured in **Google Sheets**; **email automation** (confirmation to user, notification to admin) via SMTP.
- **Pre-launch:** Countdown and early-bird scholarship messaging in place; classes begin **May 2026**.
- **Next:** Cohort fill, first batches, feedback loops, and iteration on curriculum and delivery.

---

## 8. Why Now

- **AI and future of work:** Parents and schools want students to be “AI-ready” — but that starts with logic and coding fundamentals, which we provide.
- **NEP and digital India:** Policy and sentiment support coding and digital literacy in school-age education.
- **Edtech reset:** Post–COVID, the market rewards **sustainable unit economics** and **real learning outcomes**. We are building for both from day one.
- **Timing:** Launching in 2026 allows us to capture the next wave of parents and students making coding decisions for the long term.
